The core idea is simple: Your platform is just a middleman that listens for signals. It doesn't go and "check" other websites — other tools send signals TO you. Here's how that chain works.
First, the big picture — who talks to who:

Now let me break down what a webhook actually is, because this is the concept that everything else depends on:

Now the most important part — what actually happens in your backend when that webhook arrives, and how you fake it for the demo:

For the hackathon demo — the "Alert Simulator"
You build a button inside YOUR OWN app that fires a fake webhook to /api/webhooks/inbound/demo.
Judges see the exact same flow — alert fires, incident appears, status page goes red. All real. Trigger is just internal.

And finally — here's the full picture of what a user (a company) actually does to onboard onto your platform:
